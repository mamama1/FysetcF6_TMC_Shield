This shield has been inspired from the great SilentStepStick Protector boards by Watterott.

Some silkscreen has been stripped but besides that, Watterott's design has been used completely unchanged regarding the protection diode circuitry.

This board allows you to apply up to 42V (max. recommended) or up to 50V (absolute maximum, not recommended) to your motors by not connecting the VM pin to the F6 mainboard.
